name: Example Usage of Build & Push Tagged Container

# This example shows how to use the build-and-push-tagged-container.yml reusable workflow.
# The image is always built. It is pushed to the registry only when the commit is tagged.
# On tagged commits the image receives the tag name and :latest.
# On untagged commits it is built but not pushed (useful for catching build errors early).
#
# Signing is optional. Uncomment the 'sign' job to enable it.
# Signing requires OIDC support — works on personal repos and paid orgs.
